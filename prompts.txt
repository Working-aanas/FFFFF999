Generate a vintage-inspired print-on-demand design for Teepublic featuring a stylized illustration of the defunct Shea Stadium, home of the New York Mets and New York Jets, with a distressed texture and a retro color palette, including elements of the stadium's iconic architecture, such as the scoreboard, the upper deck, and the ivy-covered outfield walls, set against a warm, sunny day with fluffy white clouds, with the words "Shea Stadium" written in bold, block letters across the top of the design, and the year "1964" written in smaller text at the bottom, with a subtle gradient effect to give the design a worn, nostalgic look.
