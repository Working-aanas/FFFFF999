The correspondence on the use of green ink ( Letters, 26 June ) reminded me that when I was the editor of Martindale’s Extra Pharmacopoeia (a long time ago) I received a lot of letters written in green ink. Invariably they were promoting ridiculous ideas. I had no idea that they might have come from an admiral or the head of an intelligence service. Jim Reynolds Penrith, Cumbria

Am I alone in starting to feel a little less safe after reading that the UK and other European nations inside Nato are dancing to Trump’s tune and have committed to a massive increase in arms expenditure ( Trump hails ‘big win’ as Nato states agree to raise defence spending to 5% of GDP, 25 June )? Matthew Ryder St Neots, Cambridgeshire

Congratulations on the most savagely funny opinion piece I’ve read in a long time ( Congrats to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez on the wedding – and to Venice for running them out of town, 25 June ). There are some of us in the middle of America who appreciate finely honed sarcasm. Not many of us, but we do exist. Mike Melnyk Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US

Steve Lupton asks ( Letters, 26 June ) if there is any sort of gift other than a free one. Well, there’s always a free lunch … Geoff Holman Knutsford, Cheshire

“Free” gift? There’s always a bit of blackmail somewhere. Marion Kuit Kendal, Cumbria

Can I widen the debate? When did we lose the definite article? On Radio 3 people play violin, piano etc. Not a definite article in sight. Catherine Williams Worksop, Nottinghamshire
