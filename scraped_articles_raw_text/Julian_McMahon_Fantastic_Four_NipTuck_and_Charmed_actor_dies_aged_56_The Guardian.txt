Born in Sydney in 1968, McMahon was the son of former Australian prime minister Sir William “Billy” McMahon. He began his career as a model in the 1980s before moving into acting, landing a role in the Australian soap Home and Away in 1990 and appearing in 150 episodes.

He made his feature film debut in the 1992 comedy Exchange Lifeguards, titled Wet and Wild Summer! in the US, alongside Elliott Gould, and quickly moved into US television, appearing in shows including Another World, Profiler and Will and Grace.

He gained wider recognition as the half human, half demon assassin Cole Turner in the hit supernatural series Charmed, appearing on the show between 2000 and 2003 and briefly returning in 2005.

He later appeared in Nip/Tuck, the racy FX medical drama created by Ryan Murphy, playing the arrogant plastic surgeon Dr Christian Troy. The show ran for six seasons from 2003 to 2010 and earned McMahon a Golden Globe nomination.

Becoming known for playing charming villains, McMahon played the Marvel supervillain Doctor Doom in 20th Century Fox’s Fantastic Four films in 2005 and 2007. He also voiced Doctor Doom in the 2005 Fantastic Four video game.

McMahon also portrayed Jess LaCroix, a special agent and team leader, in FBI: Most Wanted, appearing for three seasons before leaving the show.

Dick Wolf, the producer of FBI: Most Wanted, called McMahon’s death “shocking news” in a statement on Friday. “All of us at Wolf Entertainment are deeply saddened by Julian’s passing and our condolences go out to his entire family,” he added.

His most recent roles included playing the Australian prime minister Stephen Roos in Netflix’s comedy-mystery The Residence; Scally, the menacing surfer terrorising Nicolas Cage’s character in The Surfer; and the love interest Ray in The Supremes at Earl’s All-You-Can-Eat.

McMahon was married three times, including to Australian singer Dannii Minogue in 1994 and to actor Brooke Burns, with whom he has a daughter. His final marriage, to Paniagua, began in 2014.
