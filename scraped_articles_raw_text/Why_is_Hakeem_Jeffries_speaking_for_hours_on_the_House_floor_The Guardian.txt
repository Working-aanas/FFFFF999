After a marathon night of arm-twisting, cajoling and pressure by tweet, House Republicans say they are finally ready to vote on Donald Trump’s $4.5tn tax-and-spending package – a colossal piece of legislation the president wants passed by Friday, the Independence Day holiday.

Final debate on the 887-page bill began in the predawn hours of Thursday morning, but the Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries , has been holding the floor for more than six hours, railing against the legislation he and Democrats have warned will slash social safety-net programs that millions of American families and children rely on.
