The US Senate has opened debate on what Donald Trump calls his “big beautiful bill” as new analysis says changes made to it in the chamber will add nearly $3.3tn to the nation’s debt load while resulting in even steeper losses in healthcare coverage.

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis adds to the challenges for Republicans as they push to get the bill over the line by the US president’s self-imposed deadline of 4 July. After release of the bill’s new costs, Trump cajoled and threatened lawmakers from his own party, posting on his Truth Social platform: “REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected.”

Senator Thom Tillis announced he would not run for re-election next year, a day after the North Carolina Republican voted against Trump’s legislation, prompting insults from the president.

Trump meanwhile said he was considering forcing journalists who published leaked details from a US intelligence report on the American military strikes on Iran to reveal their sources, also saying his administration may prosecute those reporters and sources if they don’t comply.
