When working as a librarian in a scientific research station for the gas industry, I was used to obscure demands for information. Among these were regular requests from the biologists about wildlife, flora and fauna on the Dorset oilfields. The Dartford warbler ( Country diary, 30 June ) was largely conserved due to the diligence of our scientists, anxious to ensure the drilling did not have an adverse effect on the natural habitat. Susan Baillie Weymouth, Dorset

I was very pleased to see that your Wimbledon article mentioned next week’s high court review of the approval of the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s project to build “39 new tennis courts” ( What to watch out for at Wimbledon 2025: no line judges and more expensive strawberries, 27 June ). A shame that it did not add “and an 8,000-seater stadium”. Sue Jones London

I hate to sound crusty, but anyone concerned about the thickness of sliced bread ( Letters, 1 July ) should use their loaf and consider buying unsliced, or baking their own, and slicing it to suit. Richard Barnard Wivenhoe, Essex

Surely Daisy Buchanan, the author of your article ( Choose comfort, ditch boring and prioritise pleasure – how to find the perfect beach read, 2 July ), should read The Great Gatsby. Valerie Gidlow Faversham, Kent
