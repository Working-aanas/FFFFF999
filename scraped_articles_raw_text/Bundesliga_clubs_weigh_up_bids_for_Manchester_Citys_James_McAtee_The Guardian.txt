James McAtee is being monitored by a host of Bundesliga clubs, including Eintracht Frankfurt , RB Leipzig and Stuttgart, with Manchester City valuing the 22-year-old at a minimum of £25m.

Another German club, Borussia Dortmund, have him on their list of potential recruits to replace Jamie Gittens, who is poised to sign for Chelsea , while Bayer Leverkusen have previously assessed the Salford-born forward.

Any deal to buy McAtee would start at about £25m and include a buy-back clause for City. As he has entered the last year of his contract at the Etihad Stadium, a loan deal is not an option.

McAtee’s stock has risen after captaining England Under-21s to their 3-2 Euro 2025 final triumph against Germany in Bratislava on Saturday.

Last season McAtee made 27 appearances and scored seven goals in all competitions under Pep Guardiola as the City squad was riven by injuries. He previously made 75 appearances on loan at Sheffield United across two seasons from 2022 to 2024, scoring 14 goals.

Before the victory against Germany McAtee was asked about leading Lee Carsley’s side at the tournament rather than being with City at the Club World Cup in the US. He said: “It’s a tough one to answer but I don’t regret my decision at all.”
