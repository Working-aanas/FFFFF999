Former England and Manchester United footballer Paul Ince has been charged with drink-driving in Cheshire.

The 57-year-old was arrested after a black Range Rover collided with a central reservation on Chester High Road in Neston at about 5pm on Saturday, according to Cheshire police.

Ince has been bailed to appear at Chester magistrates court on Friday 18 July.

The former footballer made more than 200 appearances for Manchester United during the early to mid-1990s, winning two Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a European Cup Winners’ Cup.

He also played for West Ham, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Inter Milan during a career that spanned 20 years.

He won 53 caps for England and, in 1993, became the first black footballer to captain the national team, leading the side in a friendly against the United States just a year after making his senior debut.

After his retirement, Ince moved into management, taking charge of clubs including Macclesfield Town, MK Dons, Blackburn Rovers and Blackpool. His most recent role was at Reading, which he managed between 2022 and 2023.

In a statement, police said: “At around 5pm on Saturday 28 June, police were called following reports of a collision on Chester High Road, Neston.

“The incident involved a black Range Rover which had collided with the central reservation barrier. Officers attended the scene and arrested a 57-year-old man.

“Paul Ince, of Quarry Road, Neston, has since been charged with drink-driving.”

“Ince has been bailed to appear at Chester magistrates court on Friday 18 July.”
