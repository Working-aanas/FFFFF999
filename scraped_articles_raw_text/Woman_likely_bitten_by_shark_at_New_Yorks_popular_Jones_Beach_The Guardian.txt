A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile shark while waist-deep in the surf at a suburban New York beach, according to state officials.

The unidentified woman suffered minor lacerations to her left leg and foot after being bitten Wednesday at Jones Beach state park on Long Island. She was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening, according to a release from state parks officials.

The woman did not see what bit her, and a subsequent drone search for dangerous marine life was not successful. But experts analyzing photos of the injuries and other factors believe the bites “most likely” came from a juvenile sand tiger shark, state officials said.

Swimming was immediately suspended after the incident and resumed on Thursday morning after a check of the water by drones and lifeguards. Patrols aimed at protecting swimmers will reportedly remain in place through the summer.

Though they get a disproportionate amount of public attention, cases of sharks biting humans are rare.

There had been 47 confirmed unprovoked shark bites worldwide last year after an average of 64 annually between 2019 and 2023, said the International Shark Attack File , a renowned resource. Seven of those attacks last year were fatal.

Twenty-eight of 2024’s unprovoked shark attacks were in the US – and half were registered in Florida. None were in New York – though in 2022, a cluster of five attacks over two weeks in the same Long Island area captured international headlines.
