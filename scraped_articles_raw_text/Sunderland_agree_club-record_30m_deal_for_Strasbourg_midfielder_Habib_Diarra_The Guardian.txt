Sunderland have stepped up preparations for life in the Premier League by agreeing to sign the Strasbourg midfielder Habib Diarra for a club-record £30m.

The Black Cats have moved swiftly to head off interest from Leeds in the Ligue 1 side’s captain and replace Jobe Bellingham, who has joined Borussia Dortmund for an initial £27.8m. The 21-year-old Senegal international scored in the 3-1 defeat of England at Wembley earlier this month.

Sunderland opened their summer transfer business by signing Enzo Le Fée in a £20m deal from Roma and sold their English winger Tom Watson to Brighton for £10m.

Rérgis Le Bris’ Championship playoff winners are also reported to be interested in the Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka, who had stints at Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as Sassuolo’s French winger Armand Laurienté.
