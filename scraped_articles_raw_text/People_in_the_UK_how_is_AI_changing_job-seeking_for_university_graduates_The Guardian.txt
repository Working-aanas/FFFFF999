University graduates in the UK are facing the toughest job market since 2018 , as employers pause hiring and use AI to cut costs, according to data from Indeed.

The number of roles advertised for recent graduates is down 33% compared with last year and is at the lowest level in seven years, according to the job search site.

It comes as the UK’s claimant count, which measures the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits, increased to 1.7m people in May , 107,000 more than in April 2024.

We want to hear from graduates, parents and recruiters on this issue.
