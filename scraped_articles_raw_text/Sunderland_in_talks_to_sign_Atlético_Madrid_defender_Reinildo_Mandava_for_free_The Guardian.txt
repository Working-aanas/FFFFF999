Sunderland are working on a deal to sign Reinildo Mandava on a free transfer upon the expiration of his Atlético Madrid contract, as they prepare for life back in the Premier League. It is understood Sunderland have offered him a two-year deal worth £65,000 per week.

The 31-year-old left-back, who recently played in the Club World Cup for Atlético, has spent the past three-and-a-half years with the La Liga side but did not renew his contract beyond the conclusion of the tournament America. While in the Spanish capital, Reinildo was often the second choice left-back, making 74 league appearances during his time after joining in 2022 from Lille.

The Black Cats are making strides with their recruitment. On Saturday they agreed a club-record £30m fee for Habib Diarra from Strasbourg. The Senegal midfielder is expected to complete his medical next week and is seen as a coup for the Premier League newcomers, beating Milan and Leeds to his signature. Sassuolo’s French winger Armand Laurienté is also of interest to the club, who have also explored re-signing Jordan Henderson from Ajax.

Sunderland are also interested in Nice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka but is thought he has agreed a deal to join Saudi Arabian side Neom.
