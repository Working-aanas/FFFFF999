Four people have been remanded in custody after two Voyager aircraft were damaged at RAF Brize Norton in a demonstration allegedly carried out by members of Palestine Action.

Amy Gardiner-Gibson, 29, Jony Cink, 24, Daniel Jeronymides-Norie, 36, and Lewis Chiaramello, 22, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday. They spoke only to confirm their names.

The incident in Oxfordshire on 20 June caused about £7m worth of damage to the aircraft, police said previously.

Counter-terrorism policing south-east on Wednesday charged the defendants with conspiracy to enter a prohibited place knowingly for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the United Kingdom, and conspiracy to commit criminal damage, under the Criminal Law Act 1977.

There was applause and chants of “free Palestine” from the packed public gallery as the defendants were led away.

They will next appear at the Old Bailey on 18 July.
