People holding signs referencing Palestine Action have been arrested by police a day after the group was banned as a terrorist organisation.

More than two dozen people gathered close to the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Parliament Square in London on Saturday, holding signs that appeared to express support for the group.

At about 1.40pm, Metropolitan police officers began arresting people who were holding the signs.
