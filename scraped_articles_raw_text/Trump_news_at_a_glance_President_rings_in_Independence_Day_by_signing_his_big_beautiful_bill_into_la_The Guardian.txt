Donald Trump kicked off Independence Day by signing into law his sweeping tax and spending bill during a Fourth of July picnic at the White House.

The president’s signature legislation, which he called the “big, beautiful bill”, introduces major changes including tax cuts, spending boosts for defence and more aggressive funding for an immigration crackdown.

Trump says the changes will spur economic growth, but Democrats described the passage of the bill as a “dark day” for the nation, warning it will benefit the wealthy and hit low-income earners the hardest.
