A murder investigation is under way after a pregnant woman was found dead in County Down, Northern Ireland, say police.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has named her as Sarah Montgomery, 27, a mother of two. Police have arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of murder.

Det Ch Insp Tom Phillips said a report was made to police at about 2.15pm on Saturday that a seriously injured, unconscious woman was inside a house in the Elmfield Walk area of Donaghadee.

“Officers attended, alongside colleagues from the Northern Ireland ambulance service, who provided medical treatment at the scene,” he added.

He said that Montgomery, who was also pregnant, was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family had been made aware of the news and were being supported by specially trained officers, he said.

“Inquiries are at an early stage into this deeply tragic case. Our thoughts are also with Sarah’s family during this incredibly difficult time as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened,” Phillips said.

Ch Insp Yvonne McManus added: “We understand this news will cause shock and concern within the community. Local people will see our officers in and around the area, with cordons still in place today. Should anyone have any concerns or want to ask for help or advice, please speak to us. We want to help.”

McManus added that the police recognised the “profound impact” that violence against women had on society, and addressing the issue remained a “key priority” for the police.

She said: “We are committed to engaging directly with the local community to offer support, build trust, and help people feel safe. I am appealing to anyone who believes they may have information which could assist us with our investigation to contact us on 101.”
