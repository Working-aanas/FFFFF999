Newcastle United are optimistic of striking a deal to sign the Nottingham Forest forward Anthony Elanga after submitting an improved offer worth about £55m. Last week Newcastle had a £45m bid rejected but have returned with an increased offer.

Newcastle and Eddie Howe are long-term admirers of Elanga, who featured for Forest in every Premier League match last season, scoring six goals and providing 11 assists as Nuno Espírito Santo’s side qualified for the Europa Conference League, returning to European competition for the first time since 1995-96. Newcastle qualified for the Champions League after finishing fifth.

Newcastle are yet to finalise a deal for the 23-year-old but have been given encouragement that they are nearing an agreement.

The Sweden forward joined Forest from Manchester United, who are thought to have inserted a sell-on clause in the £15m deal that took Elanga to the City Ground two years ago.

He has scored 11 goals in 83 appearances for Forest, where he is under contract until 2028.
