The 15-year-old boy who killed the elderly dog walker Bhim Kohli in a Leicestershire park will have his sentence of seven years’ detention reviewed by the court of appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme, the attorney general’s office has said.

A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s Office said: “The solicitor general, Lucy Rigby KC MP, was appalled by this violent, cowardly attack on an innocent man. She wishes to express her deepest sympathies to Bhim Kohli’s friends and family at this difficult time.

“After undertaking a detailed review of the case, the solicitor general concluded the sentence of the 15-year-old boy could be referred to the court of appeal. The court will determine if the sentence is increased or not.”

It is understood the sentence of the 13-year-old girl also convicted of manslaughter will not be referred to the court of appeal as the threshold has not been met.
