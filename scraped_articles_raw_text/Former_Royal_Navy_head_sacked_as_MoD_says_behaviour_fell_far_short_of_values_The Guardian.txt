The service of the former Royal Navy head Adm Sir Ben Key has ended in disgrace after an investigation found he fell “far short of the values and standards expected”.

Key was reportedly suspended from his role as first sea lord in May over claims he had an affair with a female subordinate.

A full investigation had resulted in the termination of his service and commission, the Ministry of Defence said.

The chief of the defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said: “We expect the highest standards of behaviour from our service personnel and our civil servants.

“We investigate all allegations of inappropriate behaviour and will take robust action against anyone found to have fallen short of our standards, regardless of their seniority.”
