Reading Francesca Specter’s article on being a digital nomad from my temporary desk in Asunción, Paraguay, I felt compelled to offer my perspective ( My year as a digital nomad looked perfect online. The reality? Lost luggage and no days off, theguardian.com, 30 October ).

Social media posts rarely paint an accurate picture of anyone’s true life experience, and this perhaps is even more true of the digital nomad lifestyle. Hopping from country to country to pack in as many new experiences as possible is a recipe for exhaustion and discontent. The same can be said for failing to set boundaries and a routine.

I made the leap to freelance writing to provide greater flexibility for my family. We travel to spend time with family in South America whenever we can. We settle in one place for months at a time. I try as much as possible to replicate my home-working patterns, while my wife handles home-school routines with the kids. We experience a different culture and learn a new language.

My recommendation would be to pick a place and stay there for at least a few months. Try to maintain a routine that allows you time off to experience the place you’re staying in. And skip the social media posts. It’s not glamorous, but it works. Mike Potter Tonbridge, Kent
