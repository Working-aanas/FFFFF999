T his image is part of my project, Surviving the Impossible, which began in 2022 with the aim of capturing everyday life in Cuban, beyond cliches and misconceptions. Over the course of my visits, I have approached this work in two ways. First, I spend time with Cuban families, immersing myself in their routines and daily challenges. Second, I wander the streets to photograph and talk with people in a more spontaneous manner.

Both methods allow me to explore Cuba’s complex landscape, shedding light on the struggles and on resilience.

One summer evening as I was heading back to my hotel I saw a young mother sitting outside the store where she works, feeding her baby. In Cuba, cramped living conditions often force domestic life onto the streets, turning pavements into living rooms and doorsteps into cradles. Drawn by this intimate scene, I snapped some photos as I approached.

When we spoke, she explained that this was her only child and that she had no plans for more. Securing food, she said, was already a constant struggle. The store’s modest income did not stretch far enough to buy items on the parallel market, and she worried about her daughter’s future. She didn’t share her name, but we ended up discussing the uncertainty of raising a child in a place where each day can feel like a battle.

This image captures the quiet endurance of Cuban mothers, who bear the weight of an unpredictable tomorrow. Even after nightfall, the summer heat remains oppressive, mirroring the unrelenting pressure people face. Despite these challenges, they press on, clinging to hope in a country that often feels suspended in time.

Through my visits, I’ve formed genuine bonds with Cuban people, and with every encounter I feel more at home. I continue to uncover layers of personal stories – families have welcomed me in and opened their doors, and each interaction deepens my connection to the island. Their openness fuels my commitment to document and share their experiences with honesty and respect.

My hope is that, by amplifying these voices, we can begin to break down the misunderstandings that have long overshadowed the true spirit of Cuba.
