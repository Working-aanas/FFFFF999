A man, 65, has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 93-year-old woman was found dead in a town on the north coast of Cornwall.

Police have said they believe the woman and man were known to each other and described it as a “very sad case”. They said extra police officers would be seen on the streets of Bude, a popular holiday destination, but stressed it was being treated as an “isolated” incident.

Devon and Cornwall police received a concern for welfare report at an address in Cherrill Gardens, Bude, at about 1pm on Sunday. Officers and paramedics attended and the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

Detectives believe the man arrested and the woman were known to each other. He was from the Bude area and remained in custody, police added.

DI Rob Smith, the senior investigating officer, said: “We are currently carrying out inquiries to establish what happened in this very sad case. A cordon has been set up to allow for a thorough investigation of the scene to take place.

“It is believed that the man and the woman were known to each other. The community should be reassured that this is being treated as an isolated incident and at this time we are not seeking anyone else in connection to the death.

“There will be a heightened police presence in the area over the coming days as inquiries are ongoing, and I would encourage anyone, if you have any concerns, to contact officers from the local neighbourhood policing team.”

The woman’s next of kin have been informed.

Anyone with information has been asked to contact the police on 101 quoting reference number 50250165800.
