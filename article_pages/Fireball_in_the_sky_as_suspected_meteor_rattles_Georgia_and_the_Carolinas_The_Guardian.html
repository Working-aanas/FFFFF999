            <p>A “fireball” that may have been a meteor burned through the sky on Tuesday just after noon in north Georgia , with a meteorite fragment crashing through the roof of a house in metro Atlanta .</p><p>“It pierced through the roof all the way through and cracked through the laminate flooring to the concrete,” said Ryan Morrison, director of emergency management for Henry county, a suburban area south-east of Atlanta . “That’s why we think it’s part of this meteor storm.” The homeowner requested the homeland security office refrain from identifying them, because they have a small child, Morrison said.</p><p>People across north Georgia and parts of North Carolina and South Carolina reported seeing the meteor, smoke trailing its descent. A boom around 12.30pm rattled houses across metro Atlanta. Images and video have begun to emerge of the fireball.</p><p>The National Weather Service didn’t initially recognize what it saw on its radar, said Dylan Lusk, a senior meteorologist at the service’s Peachtree City station.</p><p>“We did not catch it on radar, and that is mostly because it looks like the fireball that occurred was a little bit too high up,” Lusk said. “I was looking at some of our satellite stuff; we were able to catch a smoke trail.”</p><p>The fireball resembled a lightning strike on the service’s global lightning mapper, he said. The Atlanta area has had a spate of strong lightning storms over the last day, which led many to dismiss the boom as more lightning.</p><p>A meteor strike is uncharted territory, Lusk said. “We’re not experts on this stuff,” he said. Space debris or asteroids are the purview of Nasa, he added.</p>
