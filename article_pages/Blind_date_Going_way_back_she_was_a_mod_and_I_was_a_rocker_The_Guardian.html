To meet a lovely stranger, get to know them and hopefully find a connection.Plus a delicious meal.</p><p>First impressions? Susan was lovely, friendly and put me at ease.</p><p>What did you talk about? Our mutual interest in the theatre. Our varied employment histories and both being extras – I was impressed by her encounters with some well-known actors.</p><p>Most awkward moment? Going way back, she was a mod and I was a rocker, and we talked about that old rivalry. Although I’m not sure my Francis-Barnett 150cc motorcycle with a top speed of 45mph downhill really counts as me being a rocker.</p><p>Good table manners? Susan was punctual, and we shared a starter and the vegetable selection for our swordfish steaks.</p><p>Best thing about Susan? Her openness and zest for life.</p><p>Would you introduce Susan to your friends? Yes, she would get on well with them.</p><p>Describe Susan in three words Lovely, intelligent and punctual.</p><p>What do you think Susan made of you? That my conversation went off-piste a bit and I overshared for a first date. Otherwise, that I was an OK bloke!</p><p>Did you go on somewhere? We went to a bar, sat outside and chatted until Susan had to catch her train.</p><p>And … did you kiss? We agreed not to on a first date but had a good hug.</p><p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Less rambling from me.</p><p>Marks out of 10? A definite 10.</p><p>Would you meet again? We talked about meeting again when she returns from a trip abroad.</p><img src="images/1862_5495654407987108073.jpg" alt="Susan and Andrew on their date." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Susan and Andrew on their date</p><img src="images/3198_6589760325933027513.jpg" alt="Susan" class="rounded-lg"><h2>Susan on Andrew</h2><p>What were you hoping for? To meet a special someone.</p><p>First impressions? Lovely smile, very smart and well presented. And punctual – I appreciate that.</p><p>What did you talk about? Shared interests – mainly theatre. How our birthdays almost align. Studying as mature students. Keeping fit. Live music. Living abroad. And, of course, Brexit.</p><p>Most awkward moment? We were both immediately at ease.</p><p>Good table manners? Impeccable. We shared a starter and Andrew made sure we had equal amounts.</p><p>Best thing about Andrew? He was gentle, calm and seemed interested in what I had to say.</p><p>Would you introduce him to your friends? I certainly would as he was so easy to get along with.</p><p>Describe Andrew in three words. Warm, good listener.</p><p>What do you think Andrew made of you? I think he liked me as he complimented me several times, which was much appreciated. He may have thought I was a bit too assertive.</p><p>Did you go on somewhere? I had a train to catch so we strolled to the station and had time for a drink, enjoying the late sunshine.</p><p>And … did you kiss? No, just a quick friendly hug as I boarded the train.</p><p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Nothing. We had a really nice time – great food, wine and company.</p><p>Marks out of 10? 9</p><p>Would you meet again? Well, there is a National Trust house we both want to see, so maybe.</p><p>Andrew and Susan ate at Buenasado in Reading. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com</p>
