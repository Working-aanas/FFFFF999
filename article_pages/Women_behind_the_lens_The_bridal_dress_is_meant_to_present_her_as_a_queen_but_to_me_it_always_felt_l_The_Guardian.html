            <p>T hrough my series Dry Land, I explore the deep contradictions embedded in Moroccan marriage traditions – how they oscillate between sacred ritual and social imprisonment. This image was taken on the arid outskirts of Marrakech, where the earth is cracked and open, a stark contrast to the heaviness of the dress the woman carries on her body. It shines beautifully but restricts, almost theatrical in its weight.</p><p>The woman stands still in a traditional Fassi bridal garment, a piece that is both exquisite and nearly unbearable to wear. It is a dress I grew up seeing and quietly fearing – not just for its grandeur, but for what it symbolised.</p><p>It is meant to exalt the bride, to present her as a queen for a day, but to me it always felt like armour – or worse, a cage.</p><p>It was the perfect way to showcase the pressure placed on women: to appear perfect, graceful and silent, no matter how heavy the burden. Even her beauty must obey tradition. That’s the paradox I wanted to expose: how celebration can camouflage submission.</p><p>The fire represents the quiet rage – generational, internalised, contained. In Morocco , marriage is often the turning point in a woman’s life, but not always in the way it’s romanticised.</p><p>Beneath the celebrations and garments lies an expectation to conform, to serve, to stay silent. The flames at her feet symbolise the heat of that pressure – the things that cannot be spoken but are always felt.</p><p>The snake, for me, is the woman herself. Western narratives often depict Muslim women as passive, obedient, in need of saving. But I reject that completely. I believe that you only build walls or cages around something that threatens you.</p><p>The snake is not weak – it is feared. It holds power and wisdom that unsettles people. In this image, she is not afraid of the snake. She is the snake: dangerous, deliberate, watching everything.</p><p>I didn’t want to stage this in a clean, controlled environment. I needed dust, wind and unpredictability. The landscape itself felt symbolic: unforgiving, exposed and yet enduring.</p><p>The series title, Dry Land, refers to the Darija term Al Bayra , meaning “barren land” – a phrase cruelly used to describe unmarried women over a certain age, as if their value disappears with time; as if they stop being fertile, not just biologically, but socially and emotionally. This work is my response to that idea.</p><p>I don’t create these images to be pretty. I create them to spark discomfort, to shift the lens – to reclaim the narrative and to make visible what has long been buried beneath brocade and silence.</p>
