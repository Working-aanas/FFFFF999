            <p>The governor of California, Gavin Newsom , has sued Fox News for defamation and demanded $787m, almost exactly the same amount Fox paid in a previous defamation case over election misinformation.</p><p>In the new lawsuit, filed on Friday, Newsom accuses the Fox host Jesse Watters of falsely claiming Newsom lied about a phone call with Donald Trump , who recently ordered national guard troops into Los Angeles.</p><p>Newsom’s attorneys say Watters aired a deceptively edited clip of Trump suggesting he spoke with the governor just before the military deployment, when in fact records show the call occurred days earlier, on 7 June. The lawsuit alleges that Fox manipulated the footage to push a false narrative that Newsom had misled the public.</p><p>Trump had told reporters on 10 June he had spoken with Newsom “a day ago”, appearing to imply a conversation occurred on the same day that 700 US marines were deployed to LA.</p><p>Newsom denied Trump’s claim, writing on X minutes later: “There was no call. Not even a voicemail. Americans should be alarmed that a President deploying Marines onto our streets doesn’t even know who he’s talking to.”</p><p>The lawsuit says that Fox’s own reporting confirmed Newsom’s version. While Watters aired Trump’s edited quote and asked viewers “Why would Newsom lie?”, the host simultaneously showed a screenshot of Trump’s call history, which confirmed the most recent call was 7 June.</p><p>Newsom’s complaint also accuses the network of violating California’s Unfair Competition Law by engaging in deceptive business practices.</p><p>The damages sought mirror the $787.5m Fox paid Dominion Voting Systems in 2023 to settle a separate defamation case over election misinformation.</p><p>“If Fox News wants to lie to the American people on Donald Trump’s behalf, it should face consequences – just like it did in the Dominion case,” Newsom told Politico in a statement. “Until Fox is willing to be truthful, I will keep fighting against their propaganda machine.”</p><p>The governor’s team told Politico that they would drop the case if Fox retracts the claims and Watters issues an on-air apology. Newsom said legal costs would come from his campaign funds, and that if the case is successful the proceeds will go to support anti-Trump causes.</p><p>Trump has had his own legal battles with media outlets. He recently secured a $15m settlement from ABC over comments made by George Stephanopoulos, and he has sued CBS over alleged interview manipulation by its 60 Minutes program during the 2024 campaign, a case which remains unresolved.</p>
