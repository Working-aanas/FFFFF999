            <p>A 64-year-old Iranian woman, who has lived in the US for 47 years, was detained by immigration agents on Sunday morning while gardening outside her home in New Orleans .</p><p>According to a witness, plainclothes officers in unmarked vehicles handcuffed Madonna “Donna” Kashanian and transported her to a Mississippi jail before transferring her to the South Louisiana Ice processing center in Basile, reports Nola .</p><p>Kashanian arrived in the US in 1978 on a student visa and later applied for asylum, citing fears of persecution due to her father’s ties to the US-backed Shah of Iran. Her asylum request was ultimately denied, but she was granted a stay of removal on the condition she comply with immigration requirements, a condition her family says she always met.</p><p>She has no criminal record but remains in Ice custody.</p><p>The timing of Kashanian’s detention came just hours after US airstrikes in Iran . Federal officials did not comment on her specific case, though the DHS released a statement highlighting the arrests of 11 Iranians nationwide over the weekend, according to Nola.</p><p>Kashanian had moved to New Orleans as a teenager and built a life over four decades. She often shared Persian recipes on YouTube and was active in her daughter’s schools.</p><p>Her family said Kashanian had long feared deportation, especially after Trump’s election. She attempted to adjust her status through marriage to a US citizen, but was denied due to a past marriage the government deemed fraudulent.</p><p>Neighbors told Nola that Kashanian’s arrest lasted less than a minute. Later that day, she briefly called her family during processing. The family didn’t hear from her again until Tuesday.</p><p>Since then, her husband and daughter have been scrambling to find legal help, a challenging task due to the high number of detainees and limited immigration attorneys in Louisiana.</p><p>Ice also arrested two Iranian LSU students in Baton Rouge at their off-campus apartment earlier this week. Last week, Ice announced that they arrested 84 people during a raid at a south-west Louisiana racetrack. Of the 84, Ice said “at least two” had criminal records.</p><p>Statistics from early June, previously reported on by the Guardian, demonstrated an 807% increase in arrests of people without criminal histories since before Donald Trump’s second inauguration this January. Data suggests Ice is holding about 59,000 detainees in facilities across the country.</p>
