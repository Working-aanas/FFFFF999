            <p>A British father separated from his partner, son and stepson by UK visa rules says he feels as if he is “being punished for being working class and in love”.</p><p>Leighton Allen met his partner, Sophie Nyenza, who is from Tanzania, while travelling in the country in 2022. The pair had a son, Myles, and planned to settle in the UK.</p><p>But last year the then Conservative government changed the amount that British citizens must earn to be able to apply for a visa for a partner. Allen is now living in the UK but is unable to bring his family to join him.</p><p>The situation means his son doesn’t recognise him, Allen has said, while Nyenza, 32, who previously worked as a baker in Dar es Salaam, has to bring up the two-year-old and his 11-year-old brother, Alex, her son from a previous relationship, alone.</p><p>Until April 2024, British citizens could sponsor an unmarried partner’s visa if they could demonstrate earnings equivalent to more than £18,600 a year for at least six months, under minimum income requirement (MIR) rules.</p><p>Allen, from Worcestershire, was close to reaching the MIR when the threshold was raised to earnings of £29,000 or at least £88,500 in cash savings, figures out of reach for the 30-year-old, who makes £21,600 a year as a petrol station attendant.</p><p>He said: “If my mum and dad had that money in the bank and gave it to me, my partner and my family would be here – that’s what hurts the most. These are a set of rules that really discriminate against working-class people who fall in love abroad. Why are we punished for it?”</p><p>Allen is being supported by the campaign group Reunite Families UK , who this week at a parliamentary event launched a report on the impacts of partner migration rules, accompanied by an exhibition.</p><p>The report argues that the rules discriminate against lower earners, leaving “working-class families to suffer the pains of separation … and the lifelong implications that we know this instability causes”, while children face “life-changing trauma”.</p><p>Allen said: “I was [in Tanzania] relatively recently and felt like a complete stranger to my son Myles. It’s ‘phone Dad’, the 2D image of me he knows, not the actual person.”</p><p>Earlier this month, a review by the migration advisory committee (Mac) suggested ministers could cut the amount that a British citizen must earn to apply for a partner’s visa and suggested scrapping the previous government’s plans to raise the MIR to £38,700, saying the increase would conflict with the right to family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR).</p><img src="images/4000_6667715779193197227.jpg" alt="" class="rounded-lg"><p>Allen said: “If it goes up to £39k I would never earn that. And even if [the MIR] gets brought back down, for somebody like me, the fees – for the application, for the NHS, for the English test – are still high.”</p><p>Allen cannot move to Tanzania because migration law there does not treat adult males as visa “dependents” in most circumstances.</p><p>“I’m stuck in quite a hard place because I’m sending most of my pay to Tanzania, whereas if Sophie came over she could work as a carer,” he said. “Right now we’re both just surviving, but together we could thrive. Sophie would pay her tax, she wouldn’t be a drain on the NHS because she would have to pay the surcharge.”</p><p>The Home Office said it was considering the Mac review’s findings, and added: “The government has already committed to legislate to clarify the application of article 8 of the ECHR.”</p><p>Caroline Coombs, a cofounder of Reunite Families UK, said: “The reality is clear: the minimum income requirement disproportionately impacts working-class and racially minoritised families. The rules must be rebalanced to prevent these unfair and damaging consequences.”</p>
