            <p>E ach year there are tweaks and adjustments to the tried and tested Glastonbury formula, and this year the eccentric Shangri-La area has had a makeover. On Thursday afternoon David Levene took a stroll around the revamped area – see more pictures here in our gallery .</p><img src="images/3921_7545529229788352829.jpg" alt="The thoroughfare through the revamped Shangri-La." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">The thoroughfare through the revamped Shangri-La. Photograph: David Levene</p><p>Late on Thursday night we happened upon a secret set at Floating Points’ new Sunflower Sound System in the Silver Hayes dance area – a special back-to-back performance by Four Tet (Kieran Hebden) and Floating Points (Samuel Shepherd) himself. They played a set on a painstakingly built sound system which had been assembled in a special tent with mycelium-based sound-baffling discs and tweeters hung from the top of the tent. The system has six stacks arranged around the dancefloor in a circle, enabling the selectors to pan sound around the tent.</p><img src="images/4096_650914320646132544.jpg" alt="Kieran Miles David Hebden, AKA Four Tet, plays with Samuel Shepherd AKA Floating Points, perform together at Sunflower Sound System." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Kieran Hebden, AKA Four Tet, plays with Samuel Shepherd AKA Floating Points, perform together at Sunflower Sound System.

Over in Silver Hayes, crowds packed out the Lonely Hearts Club, for Nooriyah’s set around midnight.</p><img src="images/6000_8002827505440494165.jpg" alt="Festival-goers at Lonely Hearts Club for Nooriyah’s set on Thursday evening." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Festivalgoers at Lonely Hearts Club for Nooriyah’s set on Thursday evening.</p><p>On Friday, the first day proper, we kicked things off with a Guardian Live talk between features writer Zoe Williams and drag queen Bimini at Astrolabe.</p><img src="images/5960_2531453925173789322.jpg" alt="The drag queen Bimini during an interview with Zoe Williams at Astrolabe fora Guardian Live event." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Drag queen Bimini during an interview with Zoe Williams at Astrolabe fora Guardian Live event.

But despite the in-jokes and commitment to the bit, the music is strong; they deliver a tight, confident performance for the full hour, which frequently climaxes in their frenetic percussive breakdowns. And when the music drops and the audience join in for a full-blown a capella, you know they’re bona fide popstars.”</p><img src="images/6720_861718091205715037.jpg" alt="Fans watching Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso at West Holts stage." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Fans watching Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso at West Holts stage.</p><img src="images/6381_1034809130345180367.jpg" alt="Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso at West Holts stage." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso at West Holts stage.
