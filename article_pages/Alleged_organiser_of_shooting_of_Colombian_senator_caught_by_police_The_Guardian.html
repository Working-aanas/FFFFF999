            <p>The alleged mastermind behind the shooting of a conservative Colombian senator and presidential candidate has been taken into custody, almost a month after the attack, law enforcement authorities have said.</p><p>Elder José Arteaga Hernández, alias “Chipi” or “Costeño”, was arrested in the north-western part of the capital, Bogotá, on Saturday, national police director Maj Gen Carlos Fernando Triana told reporters. Authorities had previously accused him and other suspects of being near the Bogotá park where Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot on 7 June.</p><p>Uribe was giving a political speech in the park when he was attacked from behind and wounded in the head, allegedly by a minor who was captured as he fled. Three other people have been arrested for participating in the logistics and execution of the crime. The motive is still being investigated.</p><img src="images/3331_9053370340998288965.jpg" alt="Elder Jose Arteaga Hernandez flanked by cops in hi viz jackets." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Elder José Arteaga Hernandez (alias El Costeño) on Saturday after his arrest in Bogotá.Photograph: Colombian Police/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>Uribe, who in October announced his intention to run in the 2026 presidential election, remains in intensive care and has undergone several surgeries. From his senate seat, he had become one of president Gustavo Petro’s most vocal critics.</p><p>The attack has been widely condemned in a country with a dark past in which drug cartels and insurgent groups murdered and kidnapped politicians.</p><p>Charges against Arteaga include attempted aggravated homicide; manufacturing, trafficking and carrying firearms or ammunition; and using minors to commit crimes. Interpol issued a red notice against him on Friday.</p><p>It was not immediately clear if Arteaga had an attorney who could comment on his behalf. Authorities said he would make his first court appearance over the weekend.</p><p>Triana last month said Arteaga “has been involved in a life of crime for more than 20 years, performing hit jobs in all types of crimes in Bogotá”.</p>
