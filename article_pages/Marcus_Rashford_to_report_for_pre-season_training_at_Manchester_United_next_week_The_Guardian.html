            <p>Marcus Rashford will report for Manchester United pre-season training on Monday after failing to secure an early summer move. The forward is understood to have no problem with returning to the club after falling out with Ruben Amorim and going on loan to Aston Villa.</p><p>Rashford, who would like to join Barcelona , is understood to be ready to train with maximum intensity and expects to play a full part in United’s preparations until any move is agreed.</p><p>Amorim exiled Rashford after being unhappy with the forward’s attitude in training and said in January he would rather name his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach as a substitute than Rashford or any United player not prepared to give “the maximum”.</p><p>The head coach has said he has no regrets over loaning Rashford even though it may have cost the team up to “10 goals”. He must decide whether to reintegrate the 27-year-old as he builds up to an opening friendly against Leeds in Stockholm on 19 July, after which United travel to the US for three Summer Series games. It is understood the pair have had no contact.</p><p>A transfer would suit all parties but there are complications. United want about £40m for Rashford, although they would also consider another loan, and his preference is to join a Champions League club . He does not wish to join a London team and his £365,000-a-week wages need to be factored in.</p><p>Rashford is understood to have worked with personal trainers on his fitness during a three-week holiday in Spain.</p><p>Last summer Jadon Sancho returned to United after a fallout with the then manager, Erik ten Hag, and was involved in pre-season and the Community Shield before joining Chelsea on loan on 31 August.</p>
