            <p>A wave of big-name acts including Taylor Swift, Charli xcx and Bruce Springsteen helped to attract a record of more than 23 million live music fans in the UK last year, leading to an unprecedented £10bn of spending across the UK economy.</p><p>A report from the industry body UK Music estimates that 23.5 million “music tourists” attended concerts and festivals last year, up almost a quarter on the 19.2 million in 2023.</p><p>While the vast majority, 93%, were UK music fans, the number of overseas music tourists climbed to 1.6 million, a 62% annual increase.</p><p>The Hometown Glory report credited Swift’s Eras tour, the most commercially successful tour of all time , with helping to drive the figures to a “new high”, while festivals including Glastonbury, Download and Boardmasters also proved to be big draws.</p><p>Other major acts who played in the UK last year included Sam Fender, Olivia Rodrigo, Girls Aloud, Chappell Roan, the Killers and Foo Fighters.</p><p>Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said: “These numbers show just how powerful the UK is as a home for live music, attracting the biggest acts, drawing millions of fans, and giving a real boost to local economies through tourism and jobs.”</p><p>Spending on music tourism hit a record £10bn last year, up by about 25% over the £8bn spent in 2023. The figure includes £5.1bn spent directly by music tourists on tickets, food and drink, merchandise, travel, parking and accommodation.</p><p>It also includes £4.9bn classified as indirect spending such as on fencing and security at concerts.</p><p>While the additional 4.3 million music tourists that attended gigs and concerts last year helped fuel the record £10bn spend, it has also been boosted by the impact of inflation on accommodation, travel and food and drink as well as soaring ticket prices.</p><p>This year, Oasis fans are expected to splash out more than £1bn on the reunion tour , more than £766 a person across the 17-date tour.</p><p>The report highlights the dominance of London, which is home to big arenas such as the O2 and Wembley, which drew 7.5 million music fans and accounted for £2.7bn of the total £10bn in revenues. The capital was followed by the north-west of England, with 3.3 million visitors and £1.2bn in revenues, and the south-west of England, with 2.5 million music tourists and £1.1bn.</p><p>Overall, the live music industry supported 72,000 full-time equivalent jobs last year, up from 62,000 in 2023, according to UK Music.</p><p>However, the report also highlights the increasing pressure on the industry, with 250 festivals having ceased to operate between 2019 and June this year.</p><p>“While music generates huge benefits for our local areas, there remain a number of challenges facing our sector such as the rising cost of touring for artists and the threat of closure looming over venues, studios and other music spaces.”</p>
