            <p>Barack Obama and George W Bush have criticised the closure of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), as a study warned it would result in “a staggering number” of avoidable deaths.</p><p>The former US presidents made rare public criticisms of the Trump administration as they took part in a video farewell for USAID staffers on its last day as an independent organisation.</p><p>In March, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced that 83% of USAID’s programmes had been cancelled. The agency is being folded into the state department, where it is to be replaced by a successor organisation called America First.</p><p>A study published in the Lancet found the cuts could cause more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030, with a third of those among children.</p><p>USAID funding for health care, nutrition, humanitarian aid, development, education and related sectors have helped prevent more than 91 million deaths in low- and middle-income countries over the past two decades, the multinational group of researchers calculated.</p><p>They concluded: “Unless the abrupt funding cuts announced and implemented in the first half of 2025 are reversed, a staggering number of avoidable deaths could occur by 2030.”</p><p>For many of the world’s poorer countries “the resulting shock would be similar in scale to a global pandemic or a major armed conflict”, they said, but “would stem from a conscious and avoidable policy choice”.</p><p>USAID was founded six decades ago by president John F Kennedy and had, until recently, enjoyed broad bipartisan support.</p><p>However, it was aggressively targeted by the current administration. Donald Trump claimed the agency was run by “radical left lunatics” and rife with “tremendous fraud”. Elon Musk called it “a criminal organisation”.</p><p>In a recorded message played in a video conference for USAID staffers on Monday, Obama said that dismantling the agency was “a colossal mistake”.</p><p>The call was closed to the media, but parts of the video were shared with the Associated Press.</p><p>“Gutting USAID is a travesty, and it’s a tragedy. Because it’s some of the most important work happening anywhere in the world,” said Obama, crediting the organisation with saving lives and playing a role in economic growth that turned recipients into US trade partners.</p><p>He predicted that “sooner or later, leaders on both sides of the aisle will realise how much you are needed”.</p><p>In his message, Bush spoke about cuts to the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) , which is credited with saving more than 25 million lives. He said: “Is it in our national interests that 25 million people who would have died now live? I think it is, and so do you.”</p><p>Singer Bono recited a poem he had written for the occasion, telling staffers: “They called you crooks/When you were the best of us.”</p>
