        <div class="article-content text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
            <p>I t is early in the morning, and my wife and I are setting off on a long car journey. My wife is driving; I am looking at my phone. It is my plan to look at my phone for at least the first hour, even though it is unlikely my wife will allow this.</p><p>“Bit hazy,” she says.</p><p>“Hmm,” I say, looking at my phone.</p><p>“But I think it might burn off later,” she says.</p><p>“What?” I say, forcing my eyes up to the horizon.</p><p>“Never mind,” my wife says, turning on the radio. I return to my phone.</p><p>“Sorry, will you clean these please?” my wife says, handing me her glasses.</p><p>“What?” I say. Instead of answering, she drops her glasses into my lap. Reluctantly I put down my phone, pull out the hem of my shirt, and fog the lenses with my breath.</p><p>“By the way, I don’t approve of this,” I say, overtaken by irritation.</p><p>“Of what?” she says.</p><p>“I mean, first, I can’t believe how filthy these glasses are,” I say.</p><p>“I know,” she says. “That’s why I asked you to …”</p><p>“And second,” I say. “I can’t believe you didn’t notice until we’d done eight miles on the motorway.”</p><p>“I just realised the haze I was seeing was on my glasses,” she says.</p><p>“That’s the best I can do,” I say, handing her glasses back.</p><p>“Much better, thank you,” she says.</p><p>“It’s not safe,” I say.</p><p>After a few minutes spent looking at my phone, my irritation subsides. I remind myself that my wife doesn’t need her glasses the way I need my glasses: she will sometimes lose them for an entire weekend without suffering any particular inconvenience. I couldn’t take off my glasses while driving without quickly crashing into a bridge support.</p><p>Something I’ve seen on my phone catches my attention.</p><p>“Interesting,” I say. “Guess how many …”</p><p>“No,” my wife says.</p><p>“Wait, just guess how many countries have a …”</p><p>“You didn’t want to chat,” she says. “Don’t try to start a conversation now, using facts you found on your phone.”</p><p>“Fine,” I say. I take off my glasses to clean them, and the world ahead becomes a blur.</p><p>Two days later, it is time to set off for home, but my wife can’t find her phone.</p><p>“I swear I just had it,” she says, coming back from the car. “Will you ring it?”</p><p>“Straight to voicemail,” I say, holding my own phone to my ear.</p><p>“Why is it doing that?” she says. “It’s fully charged.”</p><p>“Probably because there’s no signal wherever you left it,” I say. In practical terms, this means outside, and it’s raining outside.</p><p>We try to approach the problem logically. My wife’s laptop indicates the last picture she took on her phone was of a nearby pond, only 35 minutes previously.</p><p>“And then what?” I say. “Did you fling it into the pond?”</p><p>“I went across that meadow, through the gate, and then to the car,” she says. “But I really don’t think I would have left my phone outside.”</p><p>“I once found your phone in the crook of the tree,” I say.</p><p>“That was different,” she says. “I was listening to the Archers omnibus while I was weeding.”</p><p>My wife returns to the pond, while I walk the meadow twice over, getting soaked. I am longing, for reasons both admirable and shameful, to be the person who finds the phone. But I don’t see how anyone could find anything in this expanse of long grass.</p><p>As I approach the car, the rain turning heavy, I see my wife coming. When she sees me she holds her phone above her head.</p><p>“Where was it?” I say.</p><p>“It was lying on a stone wall, getting rained on,” she says. “I think I was taking a picture, and then my shoe was untied, and then … never mind.”</p><p>“Let’s go,” I say.</p><p>As we drive the sky begins to clear toward the east. The recent rain and the warm weather have caused the hedgerows to explode with growth.</p><p>“I’m glad we found it,” my wife says. “It felt very uncomfortable not having my phone.”</p><p>I do not say what I am thinking, which is: people who are truly uncomfortable without their phones don’t leave them on stone walls in the rain. I need to be an exemplar of patience, if only because I so often try the patience of others.</p><p>As we approach an intersection made blind by fresh greenery, my wife hands me her glasses.</p><p>“Will you clean these?” she says.</p><p>“Of course,” I say.</p>
