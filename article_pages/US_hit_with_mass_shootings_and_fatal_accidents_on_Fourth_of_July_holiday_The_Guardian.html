            <p>Friday’s US Independence Day holiday was marked by multiple shootings across the US, including one in Indianapolis that left at least two dead and five wounded as a police chief voiced frustration over the latest acts of violence in his city.</p><p>Indianapolis metropolitan police chief Chris Bailey told reporters early Saturday morning that the Fourth of July mayhem a day earlier was “completely unacceptable and unnecessary” – and that parents and guardians needed to better control their children.</p><p>“Hundreds of unsupervised kids down here,” he said, while speaking in the city’s downtown. “I don’t know how many times I had to say it: We are not your children’s keepers. You are! And parents and guardians have got to step up.”</p><p>Police said one minor had died at a hospital after the shooting.</p><p>Mass shootings – defined as cases where four or more shooting victims are injured or killed – were reported in other cities, including Philadelphia and Chicago and Brockton, Massachusetts, where six people were hospitalized following an early morning fight Saturday.</p><p>Violence and shootings often surge in the summer months, especially around the Fourth of July, historically one of the deadliest days of the year in the US.</p><p>The shooting in Chicago, which left seven people in serious or critical condition, came on the heels of another mass shooting that happened late Wednesday in that city in a busy neighborhood known for its restaurants and nightlife. Four people were killed and 14 others injured.</p><p>As of Saturday, there had been more than 205 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive . Perennially high numbers of mass shootings in the US have prompted many to call for more meaningful gun control, though Congress has largely left such pleas unheeded over the years.</p><p>In the New York City borough of Queens, police said one person was dead and three injured in a triple stabbing following fireworks celebrating the 249th anniversary of the US’s declaration of independence from the UK.</p><p>Meanwhile, a Wareham, Massachusetts, man is dead after being hit by a firework. Police said they found 70-year-old Robert Spagnuolo with a “facial injury”. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>Officials in Georgia reported two boat explosions Friday on lakes. Seven people ranging in age from five to 45 suffered second- and third-degree burns when a boat exploded on Lake Lanier, according to the Georgia department of natural resources.</p><p>Seven more people suffered burns when a boat exploded and then sank on Lake Nottely, the department said.</p>
