            <p>Nike expects costs to increase by about $1bn (£728m) as a result of Donald Trump’s tariff war, as the sportswear company looks to reduce its manufacturing in China.</p><p>The market value of the company has dropped by a third over the past year and it is taking action to reduce the hit, including increasing prices in the US and sourcing from other countries.</p><p>“These tariffs represent a new and meaningful cost headwind,” said Matthew Friend, Nike’s chief financial officer. “With the new tariff rates in place today, we estimate a gross incremental cost increase to Nike of approximately $1bn. We intend to fully mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time.”</p><p>Last year almost 60% of all Nike-branded apparel was made in Vietnam, China and Cambodia. Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured 95% of all Nike footwear last year .</p><p>“We have strong relationships with our factory partners, and our leadership team is experienced in managing through disruption,” Friend said. “Nike has consistently been a top payer of US duties. We will optimise our sourcing mix and allocate production differently across countries to mitigate the new cost headwind into the United States.”</p><p>He said manufacturing capacity and capability still remains important to the company, despite the 60% tariff rate imposed by the US, accounting for about 16% of footwear imports to America.</p><p>Friend said the business was working to minimise the impact on consumers.</p><p>However, he added that the company would implement a “surgical price increase” in the US from this autumn, and will aim to reduce overheads through “corporate cost reduction”.</p><p>Friend’s comments came as Nike reported its worst quarterly earnings in more than three years, as revenues slumped 12% to $11.1bn in the three months to the end of May.</p><p>Elliott Hill, the chief executive of Nike, said: “The results are where we planned. That said, we’re not happy with where we are.”</p><p>Mamta Valechha, an analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Nike continues to slump, with its fourth quarter the worst in at least two decades.”</p><p>She said the figures indicated Nike “may nearly be at rock bottom”, adding: “It has been a difficult period for Nike following the pandemic, and the threat of tariffs simply is not helping the situation for the company.”</p>
