            <p>Six people were killed when a small plane crashed minutes after taking off from an Ohio airport, officials said.</p><p>The Cessna 441 with six people on board crashed near Youngstown-Warren regional airport on Sunday morning, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities remained on the scene on Monday.</p><p>There were no survivors, Anthony Trevena, the executive director of Western Reserve Port Authority, said at a news conference. The victims were taken to the Trumbull county coroner’s office, Trevena said, but he did not release their names.</p><p>It was difficult to get to the site of the crash, the Howland Township fire chief, Raymond Pace, said.</p><p>“We’re very fortunate. This is a extremely tragic situation, but it could have been worse,” Pace said, noting that there were three houses near the spot where the plane crashed.</p><p>Publicly available flight tracking data showed that the plane’s destination was Bozeman, Montana, said Michael Hillman, president of the aviation company JETS FBO Network.</p><p>“These were the best of the best in terms of the folks here at the field, as well as the pilots. I can’t say enough about them,” Hillman said at the news conference. “I’d give anything to rewind the day and take them to breakfast instead.”</p><p>The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate and the NSTB will lead the investigation.</p>
