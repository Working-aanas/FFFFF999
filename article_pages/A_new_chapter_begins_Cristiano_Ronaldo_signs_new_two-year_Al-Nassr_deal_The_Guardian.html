            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a new two-year deal at Al-Nassr, extending his stay with the Saudi Pro League team to June 2027, when the forward will be 42.</p><p>“Al Nassr Club Company officially signed a contract extension with Cristiano Ronaldo,” the Riyadh-based club posted on X. “[The] Al Nassr captain’s contract will be valid until 2027.”</p><p>“A new chapter begins. Same passion, same dream. Let’s make history together,” Ronaldo posted on his Instagram account, alongside a picture of his contract signing. The former Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester United star’s existing deal had been due to expire at the end of June.</p><p>It marks a dramatic turn of events after Ronaldo posted “the chapter is over” on social media following Al-Nassr’s final league game of the season last month. That fuelled speculation the five-time Ballon d’Or winner was to leave the club.</p><p>The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, then claimed Ronaldo was in discussions over potentially joining a side that had qualified for the Club World Cup. The Portugal captain confirmed there had been “plenty of contact” with clubs , but that he had opted against pursuing a move any further.</p><p>Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in December 2022 as a free agent after leaving United, following a controversial interview in which he criticised the Premier League club and then manager Erik ten Hag. He has scored 99 goals in 111 appearances for Al-Nassr and netted 35 last season to win the Saudi Pro League’s golden boot award for top scorer.</p><p>Ronaldo has scored 938 goals for club and country in his career, needing 62 more to reach the 1,000 mark.</p><p>Al-Nassr are without a manager after parting company with Stefano Pioli on Wednesday. The former Milan manager, who was appointed in September, led Al-Nassr to a third-placed finish last season, 13 points behind the champions, Al-Ittihad.</p>
