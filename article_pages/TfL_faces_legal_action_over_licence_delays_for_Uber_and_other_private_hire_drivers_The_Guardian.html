            <p>Transport for London is facing an “unprecedented” legal challenge from the union representing Uber and other minicab drivers over claims that delays in issuing licences have damaged their livelihoods.</p><p>TfL has previously apologised for delays in licensing but drivers and their union, the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), say they are launching the legal action because of systemic and continuing problems with licensing for this group of drivers.</p><p>There are 108,000 private hire drivers in London , many of whom work for Uber. The exact number who have experienced problems with delays in their licences being issued is not known, but according to Alex Marshall, the IWGB’s president, the union has a WhatsApp group that includes about 1,000 drivers experiencing licensing problems.</p><p>Many of these drivers are not high earners and have limited savings, so even a relatively short delay in TfL issuing them with a licence can have a significant financial impact because they require one to legally work in London.</p><p>Some drivers have reported losing their homes and having their vehicles repossessed as a result of not being able to drive their taxis because of a licensing delay.</p><p>One driver, Robert Dale , 65, died after suffering a heart attack last November. He was waiting for his licence to be renewed at the time of his death. His family say they believe his death was linked to the delay as he was unable to work and was stressed and anxious.</p><p>Raifu Akanmu, an Uber driver who applied to renew his licence in January, several months before his previous one was due to expire, is still waiting to receive his new licence and is unable to work as his previous one expired at the end of May.</p><p>“I have run out of money to pay my bills,” he said. “I just keep thinking about how I’m going to survive and support my family. I’ve been a driver for 17 years but have never experienced problems like this before. I know so many other Uber drivers who are affected. All we want to do is work.”</p><p>The union has sent a pre-action letter informing TfL that it is investigating the possibility TfL breached the law in its handling of licence delays.</p><p>Union officials say thousands of minicab drivers have been unable to work, sometimes for months at a time.</p><p>Another driver, who gave his name as Lee, said: “The legal side of things has to happen. The word that keeps popping up is ‘accountability’. We have fewer legal rights and protections than many other workers. This legal challenge is a case of drivers in London saying ‘no’ and ‘enough’.</p><p>“I had to wait eight months for my licence to be renewed. The licensing process is not fit for purpose.”</p><p>Marshall said: “The drivers are predominantly Uber. I have seen so many lives decimated by this, drivers having to move out of their homes and their cars repossessed. We have instructed lawyers to litigate because we need systemic change.”</p><p>Ahmed Aydeed of Deighton Pierce Glynn Solicitors, which is bringing the legal challenge against TfL, said: “TfL is operating an unlawful system by failing to ensure continuity of licensing for private hire drivers. Both IWGB and drivers have bravely teamed up in this unprecedented legal challenge to hold TfL to account. Any public authority and government that strips people of their livelihood is not fit for purpose.”</p><p>A TfL spokesperson said: “We are very sorry to drivers who have experienced issues with our processing times of private hire driver licences.</p><p>“ We have worked with urgency to take a number of steps to mitigate the impact of these delays, including recruiting and training additional staff and granting short-term private hire vehicle driver licences where appropriate. We continue to take every possible step to rectify the delays quickly and ensure that all drivers who meet licensing requirements are licensed and able to work.”</p>
