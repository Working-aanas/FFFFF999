            <p>Name: Fridge cigarette.</p><p>Age: As a thing, not so new, but the term has only really been knocking about for a few weeks, since a user called @reallyrachelreno posted a video .</p><p>On TikTok ? On TikTok, of herself in the park on a sunny day, cracking open a can of Diet Coke and taking a sip, with Taylor Swift’s Cruel Summer playing over the top. With the caption: “Overheard someone call Diet Coke a ‘fridge cigarette’ and nothing’s been more true to me since.”</p><p>So she didn’t actually come up with it herself? No, but that’s not important.</p><p>What is? That the video has now had 3.8m views.</p><p>So a fridge cigarette is what gen Z is calling a cold can of pop? Correct.</p><p>Is it even addictive? Does it give you cancer and heart disease and the rest? No! (Definitely not, say the lawyers.) It’s not about cigarettes; it’s about that moment.</p><p>Which moment? “I feel like it’s one of those things that doesn’t need a lot of explanation,” Reno, a freelance creator in New York, told the New York Times .</p><p>I’m sorry, Reno, but I feel it does. She went on to say that “the crack of the can is like the spark of a lighter”.</p><p>Different sound. That’s not the point. Don’t be so pedantic. It’s about expectation. Look, @josiepeaches gets it.</p><p>Also on TikTok? Also on TikTok . She says: “I’ve never related to anything more in my life!”</p><p>She also says she doesn’t even smoke . Again, it doesn’t matter; it’s about the ritual, taking a break from your routine to reach not into a pack of Lucky Strikes but into the fridge for a cold, crispy one. Then the hit, not of nicotine to the brain, but bubbles and artificial sweeteners …</p><p>Mmmm. I remember when a Diet Coke break meant ogling ripped topless workmen out of the office window. Well, that was the 90s and 00s, when objectifying the male body was acceptable. Not any more.</p><p>But it’s OK to associate fizzy drinks with a dangerous drug that kills people? It’s like smoking without the smoking, taking the edge off without taking years off your life.</p><p>I’m not sure fizzy drinks are that healthy, are they? They’re not as bad as smoking, and this is a generation that cares about its health and wellbeing, but also about work-life balance, and taking a moment to escape the pressure …</p><p>And TikTok. And TikTok.</p><p>Do say: “A juice, perhaps? Or a ‘fridge vape’, as I call them …”</p><p>Don’t say : “I’m going out for a smoke. Or should I say a ‘tobacco spritz’?”</p>
