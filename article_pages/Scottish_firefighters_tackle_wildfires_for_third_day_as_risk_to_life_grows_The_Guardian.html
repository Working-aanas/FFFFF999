            <p>Firefighters battled wildfires in the Scottish Highlands for a third day on Monday in a situation the first minister has called “extremely serious”.</p><p>The Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA), which has helped tackle the blazes, warned the fires are “becoming a danger to human life” that are leaving “stretched” firefighters unable to attend other incidents.</p><p>On Saturday morning, the Scottish fire and rescue service was alerted to a fire near the Highland village of Carrbridge. By Monday evening, the fire service said it was still tackling several wildfire incidents in the area.</p><p>At 8.40pm on Monday, the fire service urged residents in the vicinity of the fire to “ensure their windows and doors are closed to prevent smoke from entering”.</p><p>It said: “Our firefighters continue to work tirelessly to tackle several wildfire incidents from Carrbridge in Highland to Dallas, outside Forres in Moray.</p><p>“A significant number of resources and special resources have been mobilised throughout the area.”</p><p>A flood alert was issued for some of the affected areas by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, which said: “Minor flooding impacts and disruption to travel is possible if the heaviest rain falls in vulnerable areas.”</p><p>The SGA said that a “round-the-clock effort” from gamekeepers and land managers, working with the fire service, helped prevent two fires from merging into one larger blaze – a move that would have been a “nightmare scenario”.</p><p>Scottish first minister John Swinney said on X: “The wildfires that are taking place are extremely serious. Please follow all of the advice available. Grateful to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service⁦⁩ and local people for their efforts to get the fires under control.</p><p>Fergus Ewing, the MSP for Inverness and Nairn constituency, said the wildfires “raging” across the area were “said by many locals to be the worst in our history”.</p><p>He added that he had already urged the Scottish government to convene its emergency response committee – the Scottish government resilience room, known as SGORR.</p><p>The SGA called on the Scottish government’s nature advisers at NatureScot to visit the sites of these blazes to see first-hand their impact and the efforts required to tackle them.</p><p>Speaking about the blazes, an SGA spokesperson said: “This is becoming a danger to human life because firefighters are becoming so stretched dealing with wildfires that they don’t have the resources to attend other fires.”</p><p>They insisted: “We need to have the Scottish government and their advisers out now to see what is happening, while these fires are ongoing.”</p><p>One witness, who tried to put the initial fire out, told BBC Scotland News that the seat of the wildfire was a ring of stones where a camp fire had been lit and camping chairs had been abandoned.</p><p>Dræyk van der Hørn, a Scottish Greens councillor for Moray, photographed the wildfires from a summit in the Cairngorms earlier on Monday.</p><p>He said: “Wildfires in Scotland were once a rarity. Not any more.</p><p>“Hotter, drier springs and summers – driven by the accelerating climate crisis – are turning our landscapes into tinderboxes.</p><p>“Fires are now more frequent, more intense and more destructive. This is not a distant warning.</p><p>“Climate change is here, and Moray, and Scotland are on the frontline.”</p>
