            <p>Arsenal are hopeful of agreeing a deal to sign Cristhian Mosquera after holding talks with Valencia over the Spain under 21 international.</p><p>Mikel Arteta is keen to strengthen his defensive options and has identified Mosquera – who came through Valencia’s academy and has played 90 games for the first team – as their main target to provide back-up to William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhães.</p><p>Arsenal are scheduled to hold more talks and are expected to offer about £16m for the 21-year-old, who also has interest from Real Madrid. Personal terms are not expected to be an issue for the player, who featured against England in Spain’s quarter-final defeat at the European Under 21 Championship last Saturday.</p><p>Arsenal are also expected to wrap up the signing of Christian Nørgaard from Brentford in the coming days having agreed a fee worth up to £15m for the Denmark midfielder. He will be joined by Martín Zubimendi from Real Sociedad but Thomas Partey looks poised to leave after failing to agree a contract extension.</p><p>Nottingham Forest’s hopes of signing Timothy Weah and Samuel Mbangula from Juventus for a combined £19.6m have been dashed after the pair rejected the move.</p><p>The United States forward Weah – a son of Ballon d’Or winner George – and the Belgian winger Mbangula were left out of the Juventus squad beaten 5-2 by Manchester City on Thursday having told the Italian club that they were not interested in joining the Premier League side.</p><p>Bournemouth, Everton and Leeds are also understood to be interested in signing Weah, who was on loan at Celtic in 2019.</p>
