            <p>An increase in babies born to fathers over 60 helped trigger the first increase in the number of births in England and Wales since 2021.</p><p>Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed there were 594,677 live births in 2024, up 0.6% from 2023.</p><p>The birthrate remains historically low, with 2024 the third lowest total since 1977. But the small rise means the downwards trend seen in recent years may have come to a halt.</p><p>The largest increases in births were found in the West Midlands, up 3.4%, and London, up 1.8%, with five regions seeing a year-on-year fall, including a drop of 1.4% in the north-east.</p><p>The ONS said there was a “notable increase” in live births to fathers aged 60 and over, which jumped by 14%, from 942 births in 2023 to 1,076 in 2024.</p><p>Births to young mothers and fathers fell, continuing a long-term trend of the average age of parents rising steadily over the past 50 years.</p><img src="images/4560_7668065408168145592.jpg" alt="Bridget Phillipson carries a folder while leaving No 10 Downing Street." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has expressed concern over the falling birthrate.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock</p><p>The largest increase in live births was for women aged 35 to 39 years, which grew by 2.7%, while the largest decrease was seen in those aged under 20, declining by 4.6%.</p><p>Greg Ceely, the ONS’s head of population health monitoring, said: “The number of births to mothers under 30 fell, as people continue to put off having children until later in life.</p><p>“The largest decrease is seen among those under 20 years old, which fell by almost 5%, while the number of mothers aged 35 to 39 grew the most.”</p><p>On Monday, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, called on Britons to consider having more children and having them sooner, describing the “worrying repercussions” posed by a decline in fertility rates.</p><p>“A generation of young people have been thinking twice about starting a family, worried not only about rising mortgage and rent repayments, wary not only of the price of fuel and food, but also put off by a childcare system simultaneously lacking in places and ruinously expensive,” she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.</p><p>The data also showed that 39.5% of live births in England and Wales last year had either one or both parents born outside the UK, up from 37.3% in 2023 and 32.5% a decade earlier in 2014.</p><p>The ONS stressed the data did not give a full picture of a family’s ethnicity or migration history, or reflect any recent trends in immigration, as not all women born outside the UK would have arrived in the country in the past few years.</p>
