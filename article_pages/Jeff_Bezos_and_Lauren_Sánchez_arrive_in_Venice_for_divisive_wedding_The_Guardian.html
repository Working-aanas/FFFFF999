            <p>The billionaire Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos , and the former TV journalist Lauren Sánchez have arrived in Venice as they prepare to tie the knot in a lavish three-day celebration that has divided the lagoon city.</p><p>Scores of celebrities and other members of the world’s super-rich will also join the pair in Italy , arriving on superyachts and private jets.</p><p>Bezos, the world’s fourth-richest person, and Sánchez were seen stepping off a water taxi on Wednesday as they entered the exclusive Aman Venice hotel on the Grand Canal, where many of the celebrities will stay.</p><p>More than 90 private jets are expected to land in Venice before the celebrations officially begin on Thursday, bringing in guests for an event that some have called the “wedding of the century” and is rumoured to involve everything from pyjama parties to elegant dinners.</p><img src="images/2349_5268394254385442197.jpg" alt="Ivanka Trump steps out of a boat" class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Ivanka Trump arrives at the St Regis hotel.Photograph: Andrea Merola/EPA</p><p>Among the first guests to arrive were Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, and their children. The family are staying at the St Regis, close to St Mark’s Square, one of a host of five-star hotels booked by the 200 or so wedding guests.</p><p>According to reports in the local press, some of the more low-profile invitees arrived even earlier.

The guests will get to admire the basilica’s artistic gems, including Tintoretto’s The Last Supper, and enjoy a concert in the tiny island’s amphitheatre as well as amble through its kilometre-long maze.</p><img src="images/5308_8826873786404882532.jpg" alt="View of a canal and bridge" class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">The main wedding reception is expected to be held on Saturday in the Arsenale, a historic complex of shipyards surrounded by fortified walls.Photograph: Hercules Milas/Alamy</p><p>The main wedding reception is expected to be held on Saturday in the Arsenale, a historic complex of shipyards surrounded by fortified walls. The big party was originally supposed to take place in a 16th-century building in the centre of the city but was switched due to security concerns.</p><p>The wedding, said to be costing €40m-€48m (£34m-£41m), is the most high-profile to take place in Venice since George and Amal Clooney were married in the city in 2014. But while the Clooneys were welcomed, the Bezos nuptials have been far more contentious, with posters featuring Bezos’s head on a rocket blasting into space – in reference to his Blue Origin space tourism venture – pasted on walls across the city.</p><img src="images/5500_4485731542436087493.jpg" alt="A banner in a square that says ‘if you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.’" class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">A large anti-Bezos banner graces St Mark’s Square placed by the activist groups Greenpeace Italy and Everyone Hates Elon.Photograph: Yara Nardi/Reuters</p><p>Protesters say the event risks turning the world heritage site, which has long suffered from the effects of excessive tourism, into a playground for the rich.</p><p>Greenpeace Italia and the British activist group Everyone Hates Elon have joined the protests, unfurling a huge banner in St Mark’s Square on Monday with a picture of Bezos laughing and a sign reading: “If you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.”</p><p>A similar banner was pinned to a huge crane on Tuesday night in front of Hotel Danieli, where some of the guests are staying, as part of a protest organised by Extinction Rebellion activists dressed as Robin Hood.</p><p>“If a person can buy Venice for their marriage, then it’s a person who has an inconceivable amount of wealth, and who could therefore pay even more in tax,” said Jorge Molina, a spokesperson for the group. “We ask that the rich are taxed more to give hope to the planet.”</p><img src="images/2960_6184759473582220634.jpg" alt="Lauren Sanchez arrives by boat to a hotel in Venice." class="rounded-lg"><p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Lauren Sánchez arrives by boat to a hotel in Venice.Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP</p><p>Sitting on a bench close to St Mark’s Square, Demetrio, who was born in Venice, said he was more annoyed with the protesters than he was with Bezos. “I missed the water taxi home last night because the stop opposite the Danieli hotel was blocked off,” he said. “We have always had rich people here, what about the Doges? Rich people should be able to spend their money how they want. The protesters are just envious that they don’t have that kind of wealth.”</p><p>A local artist known as Picchio said: “I don’t really know who this Bezos fellow is, but what is wrong with him getting married here? It’s a beautiful city to get married in – I got married here too.”</p><p>Venice’s millionaire mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, has said the wedding will bring great riches to the city and has condemned the protesters as “shameful”. Simone Venturini, the city’s tourism councillor, said the objections voiced by “a few dozen professional protesters” were driven by a desire for media attention. “Each year we host hundreds of events and celebrations, many of which have an even greater impact on the city,” he added.</p><p>Bezos will make sizeable charity donations, including €1m towards a project that studies Venice’s lagoon system, according to reports in the Corriere della Sera newspaper and the news agency Ansa.</p>
