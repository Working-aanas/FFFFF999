            <p>The former Leicester and Everton manager Willie Kirk is closing in on a return to football after holding advanced talks with the Swedish top-flight women’s team Linköping about becoming their head coach.</p><p>Kirk, who also managed Hibernian and Bristol City before a spell as Manchester United’s assistant manager, has been out of management since he was sacked by Leicester in March 2024 because he had a relationship with one of the club’s players. Later last year, in an interview with the Daily Mail , Kirk said: “I’ve made a mistake and I’ve been punished for my mistake. I take responsibility for that.”</p><p>Kirk’s proposed move, which could be announced this week, was first reported by Sportbladet , which said Linköping are set to sack their manager, Jonne Kunnas. The team are 13th, in the relegation zone, but have a strong history in the women’s game, having won the Damallsvenskan title in 2009, 2016 and 2017.</p><p>Kirk is a former Scottish Cup winner with Hibernian and led Everton to a Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley in 2020, where his side lost to Manchester City after extra time. He also oversaw Bristol City’s promotion to the top flight in 2016.</p><p>Liverpool have confirmed that their vice-captain Taylor Hinds is leaving when her contract expires on Monday. The defender spent five years with the club and helped them win promotion to the WSL with the second-tier title in 2022.</p><p>The Guardian revealed last week that Hinds is to move to Arsenal . Liverpool did offer a new deal to Hinds – who can play as a full-back or as a attacking wing-back – but the club respects and understands her decision to move to play Champions League football with the European champions.</p><p>In a message to Liverpool fans, Hinds said: “Dear Reds, I’m sorry I haven’t had the chance to say a proper goodbye. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making me feel so welcome when I joined back in 2020. I wish nothing but continued success for this team and this club. I’m incredibly proud to have been part of this club and to have worn the shirt – it’s truly been a privilege.”</p>
